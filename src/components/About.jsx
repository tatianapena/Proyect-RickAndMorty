      Greetings,
      I'm Tatiana, I am Business Administrator with a specialized focus in Colombian Customs Law and International Commerce. With
      extensive hands-on experience in this field.  
      Spanish is my native language, and I'm also fluent in English and French.
      While rooted in my expertise in commerce, I'm currently immersed in a new challenge: venturing into the world of programming.
      I'm fully committed to intensive learning and thorough readiness at Henry. This exciting transition underscores my commitment to continuous growth 
      and embracing innovation.
      Looking forward to the convergence of my diverse skills and new IT pursuits, as I work towards carving a path in the intersection
      of business and technology.
      Best regards,
      Tatiana.
